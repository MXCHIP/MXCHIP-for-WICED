# JTAG speed should be <= F_CPU/6. F_CPU after reset is 8MHz, so use F_JTAG = 1MHz
#
# Since we may be running of an RC oscilator, we crank down the speed a
# bit more to be on the safe side. Perhaps superstition, but if are
# running off a crystal, we can run closer to the limit. Note
# that there can be a pretty wide band where things are more or less stable.
